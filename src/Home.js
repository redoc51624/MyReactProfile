                <p className="card-para">
                Client-Focused Delivery, Creativity, Leadership, Openness, People Growth, Relationships are SapientRazorfish core values which helps in overall development of employees and the smooth functioning of the firm.While openness may be a stated value, if the actions of the organization do not support it (for e.g. rejecting ideas from junior employees without merit based investigation, rolling out policies without consulting the consumers of that policy etc.) an employeeâ€™s perception of that organization is at conflict with the stated value. This is when things start going downhill and employees start doubting everything the organization says, creating trust deficit. Instead of focusing on what is being said, employees spend their energy on what the organization really means or intends to do, often inventing conspiracy theories of their own.
